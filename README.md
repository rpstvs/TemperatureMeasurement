# Run Down

The Microcontroller is configured to measure the voltage of the sensor at P3.4 - (This pin is made as an Analog Input).

The value measured in the pin is converted from an analog value to digital, through an Analog to Digital converter (ADC) - a feature from the 8051f340.

After converting the value, a second conversion is made to get the value in ÂºC and then is pushed to an LCD as an ASCII value.
